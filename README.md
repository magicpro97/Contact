## Hide Generated Files

In-order to hide generated files, navigate to `Android Studio` -> `Preferences` -> `Editor` -> `File Types` and paste the below lines under `ignore files and folders` section:

```
*.inject.summary;*.inject.dart;*.g.dart;
```

In Visual Studio Code, navigate to `Preferences` -> `Settings` and search for `Files:Exclude`. Add the following patterns:
```
**/*.inject.summary
**/*.inject.dart
**/*.g.dart
```
